# PPUCPP2
As I work my way through Bjarne Stroustrup's Programming Principles and Practice using C++ (3rd ed), I will be uploading here the code I write of the excercises and drills, similarly to what @0p3r4t4 did with the second edition. Now that I've graduated and have some more time on my hands, I can devote some of it to programming, and as I've always liked C++, I think now is a good time to improve my skills and learn more about it. I also want to get more comfortable using GitHub, so sharing my code here helps me with that, as well as forces me to keep the code somewhat organized and readable.


I will try to do most if not all of the excercises, drills and "try this" sections of the book, and I might upload here some notes and definitions, if I happen to write them. How far I get into the book, time will tell.
