E4.13
[13] The program is a bit tedious because the answer is hard-coded into the
program. Make a version where the user can play repeatedly (without
stopping and restarting the program) and each game has a new set of
four digits. You can get four random digits by calling the random
number generator random_int(0,9) from PPP_support (and ยง4.7.5) four
times. You will note that if you run that program repeatedly, it will pick
the same sequence of four digits each time you start the program. To
avoid that, ask the user to enter a number (any number) and call seed(n),
also from PPP_support, where n is the number the user entered before
calling random_int(0,10). Such an n is called a seed, and different seeds
give different sequences of random numbers.

Sometimes the number of cows might be misleading, but to fix that would require
a way more complex solution.
