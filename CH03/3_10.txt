E3.10
[10] Try to calculate the number of rice grains that the inventor asked for in
exercise 9 above. You’ll find that the number is so large that it won’t fit
in an int or a double. Observe what happens when the number gets too
large to represent exactly as an int and as a double. What is the largest
number of squares for which you can calculate the exact number of
grains (using an int)? What is the largest number of squares for which
you can calculate the approximate number of grains (using a double)?


Using the program from E3.9, when the number of grains gets too big for an int, it becomes
zero and then the loop can't ever end. Using double instead, the number of grains doesn't seem 
to be too large for a double, being 9.22337e+18 for 64 squares. This may be a technical issue
I still don't understand.
