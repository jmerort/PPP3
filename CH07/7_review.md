**[1] What is the difference between a declaration and a definition?**
A declaration is a statement that introduces a name into a scope, if it also fully specifies the entity declares it is also a definition. All definitions are thus technically also declarations, but the word declaration is normally used to imply one that is not a definition.

a function definition?**

**[3] How do we syntactically distinguish between a variable declaration and
a variable definition?**
**[4] Why can't you use the functions in the calculator program from Chapter
5 without declaring one or more of them first?**

functions, functions within classes, classes within classes, classes within
functions?**
**[21] What goes into an activation record?**
