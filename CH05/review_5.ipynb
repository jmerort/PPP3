    "# UNIT 5 REVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "*[1] What do we mean by “Programming is understanding”?*\n",
    "Programming consist of expressing a problem in terms a computer can understand, which involves a very rigorous formulation of each step of the problem. Thus, unless we have a good understanding of the problem we want a computer to solve, we won't be able to express it properly. It can go both ways, however, because programming usually forces us to be more rigorous in our thought, as we see our half-baked ideas repeatedly fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "*[2] The chapter details the creation of a calculator program. Write a short analysis of what the calculator should be able to do.*\n",
    "The calculator program should take as (keyboard) input arithmetic expressions composed of rational positive numbers, the operators +, -, * and /, and parentheses. If an expression is followed by \"=\", its result (which ought to be correct according to the rules of basic arithmetic) should be output on the screen. Entering the exit character or any invalid inputs should cause the program to end. \n",
    "\n",
    "*[3] How do you break a problem up into smaller manageable parts?*\n",
    "By first seeing everything we need to do, then isolating the sections that can be dealt with in a separate manner, taking into account the information they should send and recieve to and from other parts of the program. Then solving each of the problems independently, which usually involves creating different functions and classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*[4] Why is creating a small, limited version of a program a good idea?*\n",
    "Because it's less likely to fail and because it will take a significantly smaller amount of time to get to run and debug. Code complexity scales non linearly with its length, so it's almost always a good idea to develop a limited version, to have a sctructure (something we know already works) around which to build. Also, we probably don't even understand the problem we are dealing with until we have tried to solve it, so the understanding we get by developing prototypes will help us design the final product.\n",
    "\n",
    "*[5] Why is feature creep a bad idea?*\n",
    "Because it can increase the development time tremendously for functions that are often unnecessary or that can be added with much less effort once our program is working. It also makes us more prone to adding even more non-essential functions in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "*[6] What are the three main phases of software development?*\n",
    "Analysis, design and implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*[7] What is a “use case”?*\n",
    "A use case is an informal definition of what a program should minimally do, used in the analysis and design phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "*[8] What is the purpose of testing?*\n",
    "Checking if a program works and, in case it doesn't, figuring out likely causes of error (this is more doable the better testing our program has.)\n",
    "\n",
    "*[9] According to the outline in the chapter, describe the difference between a Term, an Expression, a Number, and a Primary.*\n",
    "An expression is a term or another expression plus or minus a term.\n",
    "A term is a primary or another term multiplied, divided or module-d by a primary.\n",
    "A primary is a number or an expression enclosed in parentheses.\n",
    "A number is just a floating point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "*[10] In the chapter, an input was broken down into its components: Terms, Expressions, Primarys, and Numbers. Do this for (17+4)/(5−1).*\n",
    "(17+4)/(5-1) = term\n",
    "(17+4)/(5-1) = term / term\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(17+4) = term                    \n",
    "(17+4) = primary                      \n",
    "(17+4) = \"(\"expression\")\"             \n",
    "17+4 = expression + term     \n",
    "\n",
    "17 = term                                         \n",
    "17 = primary                    \n",
    "17 = number                           \n",
    "17 = fp literal               \n",
    "4 = primary    \n",
    "4 = number \n",
    "4 = fp literal  \n",
    "\n",
    "(5-1) = term\n",
    "(5-1) = primary\n",
    "(5-1) = \"(\"expression\")\"\n",
    "5-1 = expression - term\n",
    "\n",
    "5 = term  \n",
    "5 = primary  \n",
    "5 = number \n",
    "5 = fp literal\n",
    "1 = primary\n",
    "1 = number\n",
    "1 = fp literal\n",
    "\n",
    "*[11] Why does the program not have a function called number()?*\n",
    "Because the C++ standary library already provides ways to read numbers that suit our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*[12] What is a token?*\n",
    "A way of representing a \n",
    "\n",
    "*[13] What is a grammar? A grammar rule?*\n",
    "*[14] What is a class? What do we use classes for?*\n",
    "*[15] How can we provide a default value for a member of a class?*\n",
    "*[16] In the expression function, why is the default for the switch-statement to “put back” the token?*\n",
    "*[17] What is “look-ahead”?*\n",
    "*[18] What does putback() do and why is it useful?*\n",
    "*[19] Why is the remainder (modulus) operation, %, difficult to implement in the term()?*\n",
    "*[20] What do we use the two data members of the Token class for?*\n",
    "*[21] Why do we (sometimes) split a class’s members into private and public members?*\n",
    "*[22] What happens in the Token_stream class when there is a token in the buffer and the get() function is called?*\n",
    "*[23] Why were the ';' and 'q' characters added to the switch-statement in the get() function of the Token_stream class?*\n",
    "*[24] When should we start testing our program?*\n",
    "*[25] What is a “user-defined type”? Why would we want one?*\n",
    "*[26] What is the interface to a C++ “user-defined type”?*\n",
    "*[27] Why do we want to rely on libraries of code?*"
