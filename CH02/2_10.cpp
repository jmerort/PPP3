/*
E2.10
[10] Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and
outputs the result. For example:
+ 100 3.14
* 45
Read the operation into a string called operation and use an if-statement
to figure out which operation the user wants, for example, if
(operation=="+"). Read the operands into variables of type double.
Implement this for operations called +, âˆ’, *, /, plus, minus, mul, and div
with their obvious meanings.
